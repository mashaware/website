          <h3>Illustration</h3>
          <p>
            I’m fascinated by how illustration can convey a story without words
            in any form. I love using sketching and storytelling techniques in
            my work process as well as daily life. I always look out for new
            talent and inspiration, and support independent illustrators.

          <h3>Language</h3>
          <p>
            Through learning and teaching, foreign languages have always been a
            part of my life. Exploring the psychological aspects of language and
            observing my students using online platforms and apps for learning
            English was one of the key factors that inspired me to requalify in
            UX.

          <h3>Nature</h3>
          <p>
            I love observing all kinds of animals in their natural habitat. Just
            to clarify: before I moved to London, I kept two giant snails as
            pets (now my parents take care of them). Urban wildlife in London is
            incredible: the abundance and variety of birds and plants is a
            genuine bliss!

          <h3>Science</h3>
          <p>
            Studying behavioural genetics and neuroscience made me more
            sceptical about popular psychology news; I’m always eager to know
            what’s out there - but also, how reliable it is. It also helped me
            to realise how limited the access to scientific findings is - and
            would be happy to work on a project making knowledge more
            accessible.
