        <h4>What’s the best advice you’ve heard recently?</h4>

          “Reject the state of distracted hyperconnectedness” - I’ve recently
          listened to Cal Newport on Dr Rangan Chatterjee’s podcast Feel Better
          Live More discussing <a href="https://drchatterjee.com/social-media-making-ill-cal-newport/">How Social Media Can Make You Ill (ep 50)</a>. As
          somebody who’s been struggling with how addictive and distracting
          social media is myself, I find the public acknowledgment of how it
          affects our mental health empowering - as well as a reminder to keep
          it in mind when designing new digital products.

        <h4>What is a product that you wish existed?</h4>

        <p>
          A tool allowing publicly shared artwork without watermarking or
          otherwise distorting - yet preventing any attempt to download,
          screenshot or copy it. Independent self-published artists suffer from
          various forms of copyright violation: from using their art for
          promoting products without credit online, to analog distribution
          without their consent or reimbursement. I wish the internet was a
          safer place for creators to showcase their work.

        <h4>What’s your guilty pleasure?</h4>
        <p>
          I was obsessed with indie as a teenager, growing up in a tiny Siberian
          town without access to MTV or record shops - I’d learn everything from
          the local radio. When I first arrived in London, I booked all the gigs
          I could attend within my visa duration - including Arcade Fire in
          Belfast. I hate the crowds but hearing the artists I loved live is
          something I keep doing to indulge the 13 year old me who wouldn't have
          believed I'd ever be able to.
